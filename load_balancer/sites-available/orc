# https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport
# If you set the type field to NodePort, the Kubernetes master will allocate a port from a range specified by
# --service-node-port-range flag (default: 30000-32767),
# and each Node will proxy that port (the same port number on every Node) into your Service.
# => That's why we add all nodes into upstream
